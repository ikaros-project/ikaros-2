	including_file.ikc
	
    This is an advanced example of some features of the IKC file format
	
	This file demonstrates how to include an external file to be used as a module
    Here, the file double_randomizer.ikc is included
	
    The result is analogous to using the single file group.ikc
-->

<group>
	
	<module
		class = "double_randomizer"
		name = "DoubleRandomizer"
		max = "5"
	/>

	<!-- The add module is used to add the two outputs from DoubleRandomizer -->

	<module
		class = "Add"
		name = "Add"
	/>
	
	<!-- The connections from the group are automatically mapped to the outputs of R1 and R2 -->
	
	<connection  source = "DoubleRandomizer.X"  target = "Add.INPUT1" />
	<connection  source = "DoubleRandomizer.Y"  target = "Add.INPUT2" />

	<!-- The views can only refer to the outputs at the outer level (not directly to R1.OUTPUT) -->

	<view name="Main View">
		<object class="BarGraph" name="X" module="DoubleRandomizer" source="X" x="0" y="0" max="10"/>
		<object class="BarGraph" name="Y" module="DoubleRandomizer" source="Y" x="1" y="0" max="10" />
		<object class="BarGraph" name="Sum" module="Add" source="OUTPUT" x="0" y="1" max="10" />
	</view>
