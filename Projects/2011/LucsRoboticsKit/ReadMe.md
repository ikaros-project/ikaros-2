# LUCS Robotics Kit 

To allow students to interact with Ikaros, the LUCS Robotics Kit was developed. It consists of a small robot arm with three degrees of freedom together with a Kinect sensor and a set of cubes with fiducial markers. The robot arm uses three AX-12 servos (Robotis) that are connected to a computer over USB. These robot system have been used in a large number of student projects involving Ikaros and the actual robot arm has been modified in many ways to include a head or a hook or even the cosmetics to make it look like a rooster.
